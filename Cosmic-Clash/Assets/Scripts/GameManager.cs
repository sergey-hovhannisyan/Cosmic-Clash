   // Create Interfaces for the classes you need and use GameManager as interface
   // in all other classes. Do not directly include enemy in player or thing like that. 
   // Make sure to find the object using code rather than assigning the scene. It will reduce the 
   // amount of work for creating a new scene. Also, keep in mind as we grow we might come up with core
   // so we can drag and drop in scenes and have complete game. 
   // Please, be descriptive: function -> does something to something = startPlayerShootingAnimation()
   // Don't worry if the function or variable names are long :)
   // HAVE FUN!
